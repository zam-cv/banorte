Banorte's economic analysis predicts a 1.3% growth for the Mexican economy in 2024, with the Bank of Mexico's interest rate ending at 10% and the exchange rate at 19.90 pesos per dollar.  This forecast considers the global economic slowdown, influenced by geopolitical factors, the lagged effect of restrictive monetary policies, and post-pandemic normalization of production and consumption.  Banorte suggests that the US economy might be the most resilient among the G10 and considers a recession unlikely.  The upcoming US elections are highlighted as a key factor influencing global trends. The analysis also anticipates that the Bank of Mexico will continue cutting interest rates, despite inflationary pressures.  They project inflation to end the year at 4.7%.  Key events for the end of 2024 include the presentation of the 2025 economic package, updates from credit rating agencies on Mexico's outlook, and the potential departure of Deputy Governor Irene Espinosa from the Bank of Mexico's governing board.  Several articles corroborate Banorte's predictions, emphasizing the complex international environment and the challenges posed by the slowdown in the US manufacturing sector.


Here's a categorized breakdown:

**1. Economic Forecast:**

* **GDP Growth:** Banorte projects 1.3% GDP growth for Mexico in 2024 and 1% in 2025. This is a significant slowdown from the 3.2% growth observed in 2023.
* **Interest Rates:**  Banorte anticipates that the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) will continue its cycle of interest rate cuts, likely reaching 10% by the end of 2024.  They predict two 25-basis-point cuts in November and December.
* **Exchange Rate:** The Mexican peso is expected to reach 19.90 pesos per US dollar by year-end.  Volatility is anticipated, particularly around the US presidential elections.
* **Inflation:** Banorte projects year-end inflation of 4.7%, with the core inflation continuing its downward trend but services inflation remaining sticky.

**2. Factors Influencing the Forecast:**

* **Global Economic Slowdown:** A general loss of economic momentum globally, primarily driven by geopolitical factors (armed conflicts, political shifts, US-China polarization), restrictive monetary policies, and post-pandemic adjustments.
* **US Economy:** While the global slowdown is affecting Mexico, the US economy is expected to be more resilient than other G10 nations, with a recession considered improbable.
* **US Elections:** The upcoming US elections in November are identified as a crucial factor that will affect global trends, including environmental, regulatory, trade, and security policies.
* **Monetary Policy Responses:** The varying responses of central banks globally to counteract the slowdown will be crucial, especially after the Federal Reserve's surprisingly aggressive rate cut.

**3. Key Events and Considerations:**

* **2025 Economic Package:**  The presentation of Mexico's 2025 economic package, due by November 15th, is a significant event that will shape fiscal policy.  Banorte anticipates a 0.9% cut in government spending in 2025.
* **Credit Rating Agencies:**  Updates from rating agencies regarding Mexico's sovereign rating and outlook will be important indicators of market sentiment.
* **Banxico Leadership:** The potential departure of Deputy Governor Irene Espinosa from Banxico's governing board at the end of the year could influence the central bank's policy direction.
* **Mexican Legislative Agenda:**  The legislative agenda, including potential constitutional reforms, will also play a role in shaping the economic landscape.


**4. Overall Sentiment:**

The overall tone is cautious, acknowledging the complex global environment and the challenges facing the Mexican economy. However, Banorte does not foresee a recession in the US and highlights the resilience of certain sectors within the Mexican economy, particularly in services driven by consumer spending.
